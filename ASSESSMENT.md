# Java Assessment

**Use `app-diagram.png` as reference**
NOTE: There may be places where 

1. Implement your changes in a new branch (branch off from `assessments`)
2. There are errors when launching the project: `.\mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run`, you must fix them before to proceed
3. Implement `GET /persons/{id}` endpoint
4. Implement `GET /persons/query` endpoint, this endpoint should accept `name` query parameter wich will be used to retrieve all the records by name
5. Implement `PATCH /persons/{id}` endpoint
6. Implement a unit test for `PersonModel` class
